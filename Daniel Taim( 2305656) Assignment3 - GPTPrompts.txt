Techno feudalism in the words of Varoufakis has allowed “digital platforms, like Facebook and Amazon, [to] no longer operate like oligopolistic firms, but rather like private fiefdoms or estates” (2021, pp. 2). These Tech Giants have undoubtedly gained immense power because they not only play a large role in people’s daily lives (Zuboff, 2019), but they also are private firms, where the CEOs have incredibly concentrated power their platforms and by extension their users. In this way people such as Zukkerburg and Bezos could be compared to feudal lords who have absolute control over the digital lives of the people that use their platforms, particularly their data and personal information (Zuboff, 2019)
ChatGPT
According to Varoufakis (2021), the phenomenon of techno feudalism has led digital platforms like Facebook and Amazon to deviate from functioning as oligopolistic firms and instead resemble private fiefdoms or estates. These industry giants have amassed significant influence due to their pervasive presence in individuals' daily routines (Zuboff, 2019). Moreover, as privately owned entities, their CEOs wield extensive power over both their platforms and users. This parallel can be drawn between figures like Zuckerberg and Bezos and feudal lords, exerting absolute control over the digital lives of platform users, particularly concerning their data and personal information (Zuboff, 2019).

Zuboff notes Google and other big tech firms have not been held accountable by the democratic processes (2015) that have previously helped correct the course of capitalism, but further emphasizes the fact that there are still democratic processes that can influence these firms (Zuboff, 2015 ,2019). The fact there is still democratic processes in place that can be used to influence these large forms separates it from techno feudalism, where the authoritarian nature of the feudal states ruled out the possibility of democracy. 
ChatGPT
Zuboff (2015) highlights the lack of accountability faced by Google and other major tech companies within democratic processes, which have historically served as corrective mechanisms for capitalism. However, she also underscores the existence of democratic processes that retain the potential to exert influence over these firms (Zuboff, 2015, 2019). This distinction is crucial in distinguishing the current landscape from techno feudalism, where the authoritarian nature of feudal states precluded any possibility of democratic participation.

Perhaps and additional point can be made about how many of these platforms support the democratic process, or “public reasoning” (Sen, 1999 pp. 26). These platforms encourage online engagement with people from all over the world and allow for people to become aware of the injustices and moral failures of these companies. This information is not easily suppressed by the platforms themselves, where free journalism enables millions of people to find information about these firms and the unethical practices they engage in, leading to greater awareness and a more concerted public effort to get these companies to act ethically.
ChatGPT
An additional aspect worth considering is the role played by these platforms in supporting the democratic process, specifically in fostering "public reasoning" (Sen, 1999, p. 26). These platforms facilitate online engagement, enabling individuals from diverse backgrounds to become aware of the injustices and ethical shortcomings exhibited by these companies. Importantly, the information disseminated through these platforms cannot be easily suppressed, as the presence of free journalism empowers millions of individuals to access information regarding these firms and their unethical behaviors. This increased awareness, in turn, spurs a collective public endeavor to hold these companies accountable and push for ethical conduct.

Another analogy drawn between feudalism and modern large digital corporations is how “almost everyone produces for free the capital stock of large corporations. That is what it means to upload stuff on Facebook or move around while linked to Google Maps” (Varoufakis, 2021 pp. 2). Zuboff has also highlighted how big tech have, “simply declared our private experience to be theirs for the taking, for translation into data for their private ownership and their proprietary knowledge” (2019 pp. 5). Essentially, they have become “rentiers” (Morozov, 2022 pp. 16) who by owning these digital factors of production are able to make money simply by having access to this data, which they can use to sell advertising space to businesses (Zuboff, 2019).
ChatGPT
Another parallel can be drawn between feudalism and contemporary large digital corporations regarding the production and ownership of capital. Varoufakis (2021, pp. 2) highlights that in a similar vein to feudalism, where serfs contributed to the capital stock of their lords, the majority of individuals now generate value for large corporations without compensation. This is exemplified by activities such as uploading content on Facebook or utilizing Google Maps while being connected to the platform. Zuboff (2019, pp. 5) further underscores this dynamic, asserting that big tech companies have unilaterally claimed ownership over our personal experiences, transforming them into data for their exclusive possession and proprietary knowledge. Essentially, they have assumed the role of "rentiers" (Morozov, 2022, pp. 16), profiting from their ownership of digital resources by monetizing user data through the sale of advertising space to businesses (Zuboff, 2019).

Morozov (2022) highlights that a significant assumption about these these large companies being merely “rentiers” (2022 pp. 16) who own the factors of production that allowed them to become “insanely profitable” (2022 pp.12) neglects the primary services provided by these companies. He highlights the fact that these companies spent significant amounts of money on research and development, and that their business models do not rely solely on big data (Morozov, 2022). This kind of effort is the “productive” (2022 pp. 16) effort that is so typical of capitalism (Morozov, 2022), and perhaps very un-characteristic of feudal lords. Thus, while these Big Tech firms may share characteristics of feudal rentiers who simply own the land, they are immensely productive in their efforts to improve their operations, while is at odds with the concept of feudalism. 
ChatGPT
In contrast to the perception of large tech companies as mere "rentiers" (Morozov, 2022, pp. 16) who solely capitalize on their ownership of production factors for exorbitant profits (Morozov, 2022, pp. 12), Morozov argues that this perspective overlooks the substantial investments these firms make in research and development. He emphasizes that their business models encompass more than just the utilization of big data (Morozov, 2022). This productive aspect, characterized by significant expenditures and continuous efforts to enhance operations, aligns with the essence of capitalism (Morozov, 2022), setting them apart from feudal lords. While these tech giants may exhibit similarities to feudal rentiers in terms of owning key resources, their commitment to innovation and productivity diverges from the static nature associated with feudalism.

An interesting analogy to a feudal form of government is how they controlled the “capital” of those that worked under them. Peasants could still produce food, but the means to produce that food, and the ability for it to be taken away was under the control of the feudal leader. Similarly, owners of Big Tech companies control the means over which many people build social capital today. They own the infrastructure on which people communicate and form networks and interact (such as through gaming and discord communities, Instagram and Facebook). 
ChatGPT
A compelling parallel can be drawn between feudal governance and the control exerted by Big Tech companies over the "capital" generated by individuals who operate within their systems. Just as feudal leaders wielded control over the means of agricultural production, allowing peasants to work the land but maintaining authority over it, owners of Big Tech companies possess dominion over the platforms through which individuals cultivate social capital in contemporary society. These tech giants exercise ownership over the very infrastructure that facilitates communication, network formation, and interaction among people, whether through online gaming, Discord communities, or popular social media platforms such as Instagram and Facebook.

Additionally, those in minorities are subject to the biases that exist in these companies and their operations, that aim to increase their wealth an influence at the expense of people that do not share the same ideological backgrounds and viewpoints as they do. Common examples include the lack of diversity in facial recognition (Buolamwini, 2018) and insufficient representation on the decision-making boards that govern these institutions (REFERENCE?), which are becoming increasingly private (Varoufakis, 2021).
ChatGPT
Moreover, marginalized communities often bear the brunt of biases embedded within these companies and their practices, as their primary focus lies in expanding their wealth and influence, often at the expense of those who do not align with their ideological perspectives. This is evident in various instances, such as the inadequate representation and diversity issues in facial recognition technologies (Buolamwini, 2018). Furthermore, there is a noticeable lack of inclusivity and representation within the decision-making bodies governing these institutions (REFERENCE?), particularly as they progressively transition into more privately governed entities (Varoufakis, 2021).

However, in opposition to the functioning of the feudal state, take the thesis done by Buolamwini in Gender shades. This has been published and supported by MIT, one of the world’s leading innovators and education institutions, particularly in the field of engineering. This nods to the democratic processes that still exist to help oppose injustices that these organizations may enact through their operations. By still having institutions of significance leading the effort to ensure issues of underrepresented groups are heard and are seriously considered as the technology develops.
ChatGPT
In contrast to the hierarchical structure of feudal states, Buolamwini's thesis presented in "Gender Shades" offers a compelling perspective. This research, supported by MIT, a globally renowned institution in engineering and innovation, underscores the existence of democratic processes aimed at challenging injustices perpetuated by these organizations. The involvement of esteemed institutions in addressing the concerns of underrepresented groups signifies a commitment to amplifying their voices and ensuring their inclusion as technology continues to evolve. This demonstrates that democratic mechanisms remain in place to advocate for greater accountability and fairness in the operations of these tech giants.

It has been touched on in this essay how Big Data has played a significant role in the rapid increase in wealth for these big tech companies. Zuboff has discussed in depth how these firms have made the model of selling users data (2015,2019), stating, “We have no formal control over these processes because we are not essential to the new market action. Instead we are exiles from our own behaviour, denied access to or control over knowledge derived from its dispossession by others for others” (2019 pp. 7). As mentioned above this has allowed these large companies to become incredibly wealthy (Morozov, 2022), as people produce the labour and products for these big tech companies for free (Varoufakis, 2021). Thus, surveillance capitalism correctly draws attention to the fact that these large tech companies have become very powerful and wealthy by collecting user data and selling that information. Surveillance capitalism therefore accurately captures the means that has allowed these companies to become the very powerful machines they are.

As mentioned above Morozov notes that capitalism has always been “nasty business” (2022 pp.18) and that he believes surveillance capitalism does not account for the primary functions of many of the companies, such as googles indexing service (Morozov, 2022). He further argues that by calling describing the modern digital economy as techno feudalism or surveillance capitalism we risk “whitewashing” (Morozov, 2022 pp. 21) what is actually occurring today, as he talks about how we should look at capitalism through the lens of history, one that has often led to many injustices (Morozov, 2022). This implies that by focusing on a single aspect of the wealth generation, we perhaps lose a holistic viewpoint on what capitalism is. A machine that has led to great prosperity, but also great injustices and inequalities.
ChatGPT
As mentioned earlier, Morozov emphasizes that capitalism has always had its dark side, describing it as "nasty business" (2022, pp. 18). He contends that surveillance capitalism fails to acknowledge the fundamental functions of many companies, such as Google's indexing service (Morozov, 2022). Additionally, he warns against using terms like "techno feudalism" or "surveillance capitalism" as they might "whitewash" the realities of the present digital economy (Morozov, 2022, pp. 21). Instead, Morozov argues that we should examine capitalism through a historical lens, one that reveals its history of injustices (Morozov, 2022). This suggests that by focusing solely on one aspect of wealth generation, we may lose a comprehensive understanding of capitalism as a complex system—one that has brought prosperity but has also perpetuated inequalities and injustices.

I therefore acknowledge the relevance of the term surveillance capitalism but appreciate the perspective given by Morozov and believe that the term surveillance capitalism may be too narrow a description. Thus, if I was to suggest a new name for the current era, I believe capitalism v2.0 would be in order. The use of the word capitalism attempts to retain the history and meaning behind capitalism, while the v2.0 is a common way of denoting an updated version of computer software. I believe the use of v2.0 emphasises the evolution of capitalism while highlighting it in particular reference to the digital age in which we now live.

Introduction:

In the digital age, the rise of big tech companies has given birth to a complex socio-economic landscape, prompting scholars and commentators to explore the parallels between this new era and historical systems of governance. This essay delves into the concept of techno feudalism and surveillance capitalism, examining their implications for power dynamics, democratic processes, economic structures, and social consequences.

The term "techno feudalism" captures the idea that digital platforms, such as Facebook and Amazon, have transformed into private fiefdoms, resembling feudal estates rather than traditional oligopolistic firms (Varoufakis, 2021). These industry giants have acquired unprecedented influence, firmly embedded in the daily lives of individuals (Zuboff, 2019). Like feudal lords, their CEOs exercise absolute control over both the platforms and the personal data of users (Zuboff, 2019). However, it is crucial to consider the democratic processes that still exist within this context. While these companies may exhibit authoritarian tendencies, they are not entirely devoid of mechanisms that can hold them accountable (Zuboff, 2015, 2019).

Moreover, the role of digital platforms in supporting the democratic process and fostering public reasoning emerges as a significant aspect. These platforms facilitate global online engagement, enabling people from diverse backgrounds to become aware of corporate injustices and ethical failures (Sen, 1999, p. 26). Unlike feudal states, these digital realms do not easily suppress information, as free journalism empowers millions to access knowledge about unethical practices (Varoufakis, 2021). The resulting awareness fuels collective efforts to push for ethical behavior and corporate accountability.

Economically, the comparison between feudalism and contemporary digital corporations sheds light on the production and ownership of capital. Varoufakis (2021) draws a parallel between serfs contributing to the capital stock of feudal lords and individuals generating value for large tech companies without compensation. These corporations act as "rentiers," profiting from the ownership of digital resources and monetizing user data (Morozov, 2022, p. 16; Zuboff, 2019). However, it is essential to consider Morozov's viewpoint, which argues against oversimplifying these companies as mere rentiers. He highlights their substantial investments in research and development, indicating a productive aspect that aligns with the essence of capitalism (Morozov, 2022).

Title: The Evolution of Capitalism: Assessing the Parallels Between Techno Feudalism and the Dominance of Big Tech

Introduction:

In today's digital age, the rise of mega-corporations like Facebook and Amazon has sparked discussions about the nature of their power and influence. Scholars and observers have drawn parallels between the dominance of these tech giants and the feudal systems of the past, highlighting the concentration of control and the exploitation of user data. This essay explores the concept of techno feudalism and its implications for political, economic, and social spheres. It also examines the notion of surveillance capitalism as a mechanism through which these corporations accumulate wealth and exert authority. Additionally, the essay considers the role of democratic processes in challenging these dynamics and proposes an alternative term, "capitalism v2.0," to capture the evolving nature of capitalism in the digital era.

The first section of the essay delves into the political aspects of techno feudalism. It discusses how digital platforms, in their vast reach and private ownership, resemble fiefdoms, with CEOs acting as modern-day feudal lords. The control exerted by these companies over users' digital lives, particularly regarding their personal information, is analyzed in parallel to the authoritarian nature of feudal states. Furthermore, the essay explores the potential for democratic processes to hold these tech giants accountable, differentiating the current landscape from traditional techno feudalism.

The second section examines the economic dimensions of techno feudalism. Drawing on the work of economists and scholars, the essay explores the parallels between feudalism and contemporary digital corporations in terms of capital production and ownership. It highlights the unpaid labor and value generated by individuals on these platforms, as well as the unilateral ownership of personal experiences transformed into proprietary knowledge. The essay also presents contrasting views on the nature of large tech companies as mere "rentiers" or innovative capitalists, emphasizing the investments they make in research and development.

The third section explores the social implications of techno feudalism and the control exerted by Big Tech companies over social capital. It draws a comparison between feudal governance and the dominion these companies exercise over the very infrastructure that enables communication and network formation in contemporary society. The essay also addresses the biases and inadequate representation within these tech giants, particularly impacting marginalized communities. It highlights the existence of democratic mechanisms, supported by esteemed institutions, aimed at challenging injustices and advocating for greater accountability and inclusivity.

The essay further delves into the concept of surveillance capitalism, emphasizing the significant role of big data in wealth accumulation by these tech giants. It discusses the exploitation of user data and the transformation of individuals into "exiles from their own behavior." However, the essay acknowledges the limitations of framing the digital economy solely through the lens of surveillance capitalism and argues for a more comprehensive examination of capitalism as a complex system with both prosperous and unjust dimensions.

Finally, the essay proposes an alternative term, "capitalism v2.0," to capture the evolving nature of capitalism in the digital age. By retaining the historical and conceptual foundations associated with capitalism while acknowledging its transformation, the term "v2.0" symbolizes the updated version of the system, much like the software denotation. It recognizes the complexities and nuances of capitalism in the present era, emphasizing the need for a broader understanding of its effects on society.

In conclusion, this essay critically analyzes the parallels between techno feudalism and the dominance of Big Tech companies. It explores the political, economic, and social dimensions of this phenomenon and highlights the role of democratic processes in challenging the concentration of power. By proposing the term "capitalism v2.0," the essay underscores the evolution of capitalism in the digital age and the importance of comprehensive analysis to address its consequences.

Conclusion:

In conclusion, the notion of 'techno-feudalism' provides valuable insights into the power dynamics and social implications of dominant digital platforms. However, our analysis reveals significant inadequacies in characterizing contemporary political institutions, economic systems, and social relations as strictly feudal. While certain parallels exist, such as the concentration of power and exploitation of user data, the dynamic nature of the digital age introduces novel complexities that resist a singular feudal interpretation. Furthermore, the concept of 'surveillance capitalism' captures the monetization of user data but falls short of comprehensively addressing the broader socio-political and economic landscape. In light of these limitations, we propose the term 'digital corporatism' as a more fitting name for the current era. This term encompasses the amalgamation of corporate power, technological dominance, and data-driven economies, highlighting the complex interplay between technology, capitalism, and societal structures. By critically evaluating these concepts, we gain a deeper understanding of the intricate dynamics shaping our digital world and the challenges that lie ahead.

Therefore, I acknowledge the relevance of the term "surveillance capitalism," but I also appreciate the perspective offered by Morozov. I believe that the term "surveillance capitalism" may be too narrow in its description. As such, if I were to propose a new name for the current era, I suggest "capitalism v2.0." By using the word "capitalism," we retain the historical and conceptual foundations associated with it, while the "v2.0" signifies an updated version, much like how software is denoted. The use of "v2.0" highlights the evolution of capitalism, particularly in relation to the digital age in which we currently reside.

In light of these limitations, we propose a more encompassing term for the current era: "Capitalism 2.0." This term acknowledges the relevance of the concept of "surveillance capitalism" while expanding its scope to reflect the broader transformations in our economic and social landscape. "Capitalism 2.0" signifies an updated version of capitalism that incorporates the profound impact of technology, corporate power, and data-driven economies. By embracing the term "capitalism," we retain the historical and conceptual foundations associated with this economic system, recognizing its continuity amidst the digital age. The addition of "2.0" denotes the significant evolution and adaptation required to navigate the complexities of our contemporary world. Through critically evaluating the dynamics of "Capitalism 2.0," we can deepen our understanding of the intricate interplay between technology, capitalism, and societal structures, enabling us to address the challenges and opportunities that lie ahead.
